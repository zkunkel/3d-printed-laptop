# 3d-printed-laptop

I wanted a laptop with 3 screens (only one screen done for now), a cd drive and a mechanical keyboard, so I used a bunch of consumer parts and 3d printed everything around it using autodesk fusion

It works by using a usb c cable that negotiates 20v from the mobile power bank to power the mini pc

the screen is placed into this mount which is attached to the base through the little hinges

the keyboard pcb was separated from its original hardware and attached to my custom mount that allows me to fold/slide the keyboard in and out of the base
